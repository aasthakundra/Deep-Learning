# Deep-Learning
README:

1) Part 1: Understanding Neural Network Forward Propagation and Backpropagation
    Overview:
    This code demonstrates the concepts of forward propagation and backpropagation in a neural network. It provides a basic implementation of a neural network with customizable parameters.

    Instructions to Run the Code
    a)Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
    b)Install the required libraries.

2) Part 2: Predicting Customer Churn using Neural Networks
   Overview
   This code implements a neural network model to predict customer churn using historical data. It preprocesses the data, builds and trains the neural network model, and evaluates its    	performance.

   Instructions to Run the Code
   a)Download the provided dataset from the link provided in the code.
   b)Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
   c)Install the required libraries.

3) Part 3: Spam Classification using Recurrent Neural Networks
  Overview
  This code utilizes recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to classify spam messages. It preprocesses the text data, builds an RNN model using Keras, trains the model, and evaluates its  	performance.

   Instructions to Run the Code
  a)Download the provided dataset from the link provided in the code.
  b)Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
  c)Here we need to upgrade pip by running: pip install --upgrade pip

4) Part 4: Image Classification using Transfer Learning
  Overview
  This code demonstrates image classification using transfer learning with pre-trained models such as VGG-16. It pre-processes the image data, loads a pre-trained model, replaces the fully 	connected layers, and fine-tunes the model.

   Instructions to Run the Code
  a)Download the provided dataset from the link provided in the code.
  b)Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
  C)Make sure all the required libraries are installed.
